description-CRE,"Number of individual plenary speeches given by the MEP throughout a term of office. Debate time is split proportionally to the number of seats held by the MEP's political group and his of her national delegation."
description-MOTION,"Each MEP can table a motion of no more than 200 words and keeping within the EP's powers and functions. Motions are however typically tabled by a political group, a committee, or by at least 40 MEPs."
description-REPORT,"Rapporteur reports - number of reports written by the MEP in the position of a Rapporteur. In the EP, committees are often tasked with preparing reports on legislative proposals and other subjects. Each report is assigned to a Rapporteur who is made responsible for its creation. Being involved in the writing of a report from the very beginning makes the person of the Rapporteur an important influence on its final text."
description-REPORT-SHADOW,"Shadow Rapporteur reports - whereas the Rapporteur formulates a committee's stance towards a given subject, minority political groups can appoint a Shadow Rapporteur. He then stays in contact with the Rapporteur, formulates his or her group's position towards the subject and, if the subject is a legislative proposal, prepares notes for his group regarding the vote on amendments and on the proposal itself."
description-COMPARL,"Rapporteur of opinions reports - number of times when the MEP prepared an opinion report on a text, legislative or other, or on a question. Both types of reports are most often initially submitted to one or more committees. For legislative texts, the opinions take the form of amendments, whereas for non-legislative texts, they consist of motions regarding the text."
description-COMPARL-SHADOW,"Shadow Rapporteur of Opinion reports. Similarly to a Shadow Rapporteur, a Shadow Rapporteur of Opinion formulates his or her group's stance towards a given subject. This indicator then shows the number of opinion reports put together by the MEP throughout the term as a Shadow Rapporteur of Opinion."
description-WDECL,"A written declaration is a text of no more than 200 words, relating to a subject within the EU's competence. A written declaration can be submitted by a group of at least 10 MEPs from at least 3 political groups. It takes the form of a text to be signed by their colleagues."
description-QP,"MEPs can address questions to the Commission, the Council or other institutions either orally during a debate or in writing. Here we present the number of questions addressed by an MEP to the Commission or to the Council."
